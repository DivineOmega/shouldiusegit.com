### But what actually is it?

According to git's own [webpage](https://git-scm.com/) "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

Basically its a way to store your code, and keep track if its history. It also lets you work with others easily and using branches you can merge code from different places even if there are conflicts.

### Yeah, but what can it do for me?

1. It keeps your code organised
2. It stops you from losing code

### What if I just dont want too?

You will probably lose work. It might not be right away, but eventually you will lose something that could have been saved with git, whether you accidently deleted it, or you removed it a month ago, and only just realised you want it back.
